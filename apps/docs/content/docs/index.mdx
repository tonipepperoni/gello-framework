Gello is a backend framework for TypeScript that gives you the developer experience you love from Laravel — elegant APIs, sensible defaults, and a powerful CLI — with complete type safety powered by [Effect](https://effect.website).

## Why Gello?

- **Type-Safe Everything** — Errors, dependencies, and responses are all checked at compile time
- **Familiar Patterns** — If you've used Laravel, Rails, or NestJS, you'll feel right at home
- **No Magic** — Clear, explicit code that's easy to understand and debug
- **Batteries Included** — Authentication, queues, mail, caching, storage — all built in

## Quick Example

Here's a simple API that returns a list of users:

```typescript
import { createApp, route, json } from "@gello/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const getUsers = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: "Alice" },
    { id: 2, name: "Bob" },
  ]
  return json(users)
})

const app = createApp({ port: 3000 })
  .routes([
    route.get("/users", getUsers),
  ])

app.run()
```

That's it. No decorators, no classes, no configuration files. Just functions.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a new project

```bash
npx gello new my-app
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Install dependencies

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your API is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.
